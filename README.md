# FarmScapes

FarmScapes is a project dedicated to automating farming processes, aimed at streamlining operations and reducing labor efforts. Developed by a team of committed individuals, FarmScapes offers the following features:

- **Automatic Watering:** Plants are automatically watered to maintain optimal hydration levels.
- **Weather Alerts:** Farmers receive alerts during heavy rains, enabling proactive measures to be taken.
- **Weed and Disease Detection:** A smart rover patrols the farm daily, automatically detecting weeds and plant diseases.
